# Extract SNPs from genotyping data (DNAnexus Platform App)

This app allows you to extract SNPs from the genotyping data via a file containing a list of rs identifiers or a list of genomic regions


This is the source code for an app that runs on the UK Biobank Research
Analysis Platform (UKB-RAP). For more information about how to run or
modify it, see https://documentation.dnanexus.com/. Documentation on
building applets can be found in the DNAnexus documentation at
https://documentation.dnanexus.com/developer/apps/intro-to-building-apps.

This app allows you to extract SNPs from the BED (PLINK) files in the UK
Biobank genetic data. The app accepts a list of variants/SNPs in two
formats: either a list of rs identifiers or a list of genomic regions to
search for variants within.

It extracts SNPs from genotyping data from field [22418](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=22418)
